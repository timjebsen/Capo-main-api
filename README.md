# CAPO
## A live music event aggregator for QLD Australia
Capo trawls through the internet collecting live music events so you can effortlesly explore the best local live music scene in Australia.

### Disclaimer
This project serves as a proof of concept and learning experience. It was started 2 years ago with minimal experience in OOP, advanced python techniques, and other coding fundamentals, and the codebase reflects as such.

The codebase has grown a lot over time, however, remnants of inexperience are still rampant such as the lack of type checking, poor class structure and methods, unstandardised API responses, and much more...

1. Main api
